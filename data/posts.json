This new rendering model allows React to work on multiple versions of your UI simultaneously, enabling features like interruptible rendering, prioritized updates, and better user experience during high-load situations. With Concurrent Mode, React can pause, abort, or restart rendering work based on priority, ensuring that high-priority updates (like user input) are processed immediately while lower-priority updates (like rendering a long list) can be interrupted if needed."
